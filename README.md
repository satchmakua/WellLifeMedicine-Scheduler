# WellLifeMedicine-Scheduler
 This repository contains a Python-based web application to track and display the available dates for appointments. Using Flask for the web server and BeautifulSoup for scraping, the application fetches availability data from a scheduling website and displays it. Users can view availability for the current and upcoming month. The project also includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment and testing.
